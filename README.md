# kyc.strongnode.io üíª
Built with Node.js, Rest APIs with Express, Sequelize, MySQL, AWS & React.

##  Prerequisites
Here is all you need for local development:
- node (+npm) & yarn
- MySQL
- Localstack (AWS emulator for local development)
- AWS CLI

## How to develop on localhost

First of all, **clone this repository**.

## üåê Localstack (AWS emulator for local development)

For faking AWS on localhost you shoud run localstack locally on your machine. This can be done via composing a docker-compose file located in docker/localstack.docker-compose.yaml.

Example of creating localstack instance via Docker
```
cd <repo>/docker/

docker-compose -f localstack.docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

**-f parameter** selects file name.<br>
**-d parameter runs** the container in detached mode


Localstack is faking AWS services (for faking SES it uses moto mocker). There needs to be initted AWS credentials on your machine (localstack does not have authorization, but it needs atleast fake credentials to run).

// we need to configure localstack account
aws configure --profile localstack


```
aws configure --profile localstack

AWS Access Key ID [None]: localhost
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: localhost
Default region name [None]: eu-west-1
Default output format [None]: 
```


By default AWS/localstack will return an error when we will try to register user - no-reply@strongnode.io is not a verified e-mail.
To fix it we **need to run following command in terminal**:

    aws ses verify-email-identity --email-address no-reply@strongnode.io --profile localstack --region eu-west-1 --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566

In order to run AWS cli against our local localstack **we need to add parameter**:
```
--endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566
```

## üíΩ MySQL
Application uses a MySQL database, so we need a instance on the localhost too.
You can get & run dockerized instance from here https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql

If you don't want to run MySQL in Docker, you can use a whole server distributions like MAMP (https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/).

Create MySQL database that we will add to .env later on. (default DB name: kyc_db)

## üíΩ Migrations (database updates)
In order to have our DB "versioned" we are using Sequelize migrations.

Migrations folder is located at `back/app/migrations`, every database change is stored in a separate .js file.

**Migrations are being run at every application start**, you can see the code in `back/app/models/index.js:19`.

###
**New migration can be created by typing** ‚¨áÔ∏è (or by manually creating file in migrations folder)

```
cd back/app/migrations
npx sequelize-cli migration:create --name modify_users_add_new_fields
```

Unfortunately, the content file it generates we need to override, because we are using Umzug library for handling migrations.
We need to have the following migration content ‚¨áÔ∏è

```
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');

async function up({ context: queryInterface }) {
	await queryInterface.createTable('users', {
		id: {
			type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
			allowNull: false,
			primaryKey: true
		},
		name: {
			type: Sequelize.STRING,
			allowNull: false
		},
		createdAt: {
			type: Sequelize.DATE,
			allowNull: false
		},
		updatedAt: {
			type: Sequelize.DATE,
			allowNull: false
		}
	});
}

async function down({ context: queryInterface }) {
	await queryInterface.dropTable('users');
}

module.exports = { up, down };
```

## üíø Backend
Backend is built with Node.JS along with Express.JS.

**Setuping backend**:

    cd <repo>/back
    yarn install 				// for BE, you can use "npm install" too

Then we need to **create our .env file from .env.sample** (eg.: below)

    APP_NAME = StrongNode.io
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID =
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY =
    AWS_REGION =
    AWS_LOCALSTACK_URL = http://localhost:4566          // used for localhost development
    HOST = localhost
	HOSTNAME_KYC = localhost:8000        // this var is being used for creating links that are beign sent via emails
    DB_USER =
    DB_PASSWORD =
    DB_NAME = kyc_db
    DB_DIALECT = mysql
    DB_POOL_MAX = 5
    DB_POOL_MIN = 0
    DB_POOL_ACQUIRE = 30000
    DB_POOL_IDLE = 10000
    TOKEN_SECRET = ae9e943d7853e70709d8ed594140e334403dfca25516ab2327e9c0ecfeace9ded2d0f9031f860f08dc4a3044e562d511f5a24d55b574ef530bd8e1571418c6c9

In case of running localstack instead of AWS servers, you need to pass value to AWS_LOCALSTACK_URL variable, otherwise if you're using AWS, keep this variable empty.

Fill all of the missing parameters in order to make your localhost BE run correctly.

## üìÄ Frontend

Front-end is created with React.

Installation need to be run with yarn, eg: ‚¨áÔ∏è

    cd <repo>/front
    yarn install


Then we need change URL address in front/.env file to point it on our local BE.<br><br>
**Example of front/.env file:**

```
# REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 # this is what local backend will use by default
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```


## üìÄ Database seed (for new databases only)

 - Run backend with `node server.js`
 - Open this URL: http://localhost:8080/api/utils/refreshEmailTemplates
 	(replace http://localhost:8080 with your current backend URL)


# üî´ Trouble shooting
List of issues I've faced on my MB Pro (15 inch).

## #1 Chrome redirects API calls from http to https
For some reason - Chrome, Firefox & Safari is redirecting API calls from FE to force use https (secured connection)
There are multiple solutions:
- remove domain from HSTS in Chrome (https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/clear-hsts-settings-chrome-firefox/)
- run Chrome with --disable-web-security flag

Second option worked for me.<br><br>


Running chrome with --disable-web-security flag
```
// Mac OS
open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security

// Linux
google-chrome --disable-web-security

// For windows, create a new desktop shortcut with the target below
"[PATH_TO_CHROME]\chrome.exe" --disable-web-security --disable-gpu --user-data-dir=~/chromeTemp
```
